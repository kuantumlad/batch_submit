Hello there!

If you are reading this, you might be a little lost. 
So let me help!

This directory holds the jsub files that will be submitted the the batch farm.
Each file is what we call a "job", and by submitting them you can run your analysis!

All you need to do is type this simple command 
 jsub filename.jsub

Congrats! See how easy that was!? 
But don't be fooled, writing the files can be tricky! 

Goodbye!
